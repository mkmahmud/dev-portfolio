Their system provides a seamless workflow that handles the analytics, decision support and digital execution of supply chain management. They do this with consulting, data science and technology. We collaborated with them to create a workflow process for this with a cloud-based infrastructure. To achieve set business goals, tasks are created by the client (business) and it moves through different stages. In the analytics stage, data is sent from the client to the data scientist for analysis to get insight into issues. Next, the system generates actionable recommendations to improve the supply chain. Say, for example, a business needs to increase the production of certain goods, there are two choices before them to realize this â€“ either buy more equipment or hire more workers. Within the application, the supply chain consultants describe possible solutions and monitor the dashboards for the implementations already in motion.",
